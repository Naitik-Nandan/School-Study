Solution 1 Correct option – b) size of prism
The deviation produced by an equilateral prism does not depend on size of prism.

Solution 2 Correct option – c) the speed of light in vacuum is 2.4 times the speed of
             light in the diamond.

T hus,

c = 2 .4  v d ia m o n d

Thus, the speed of light in a vacuum is 2.4 times the speed of light in the diamond.

Solution 3 Correct option – c) No, as the image formed will be virtual.
As the lens used is concave lens, the image formed will be virtual and erect and such
images cannot be obtained on the screen.

Solution 4 Correct option – a) NQ
The light ray MS is extension of incident ray IM.
When light ray is coming out from the denser medium into rarer medium the emergent
ray for glass slab is parallel to that of incident ray and it bends towards the normal. The
only ray which is satisfying both the condition is ray NQ.

Solution 5 Correct option – c) red
The colour of white light which is deviated least by a prism is red.

Solution 6 Correct option – d) 400 nm to 800 nm
The wavelength range of visible light is 400 nm to 800 nm.

Solution 7
i) Correct option – d) the image will be real and magnified
It is given that after refracting the rays of light are converging at point to right side of
lens. The object is placed at 30 cm and focal length of lens is 20 cm. This means as the
rays are converging the lens is convex lens and object is placed between 2F and F. Thus,
the image formed will be real and magnified.
ii) Correct option – a) to correct hypermetropia
The lens used is convex lens. The explanation for the same is given in 7 (i). Convex lens is
used to correct hypermetropia.
iii) Correct option – b) +30 cm
  When the object is placed at 60 cm to left side of convex lens of focal length 20 cm, it
  means that the object is placed beyond 2F. And when the object is placed beyond 2F of
  convex lens the image formed will be between F and 2F (i.e., between + 20 cm and + 40
  cm) to the right side. Thus, the sign according to New Cartesian sign convention will be
  positive for the image distance. The only valid option satisfying all these conditions is +
  30 cm.
iv) Correct option – c) – 0.5
As the image formed in this case will be real and inverted the sign to the value of the
height of image should be negative according to New Cartesian sign convention. And as
the object is placed beyond 2F the image formed will be diminished. This means the
image formed will be less than 1. The value satisfying both the conditions is – 0.5
Solution 8 Correct option – c) 1 Nm = 107 dyne cm
Moment of force = Force x perpendicular distance from line of action
Thus, SI unit of moment of force is Nm and SI unit is dyne cm.
1 N = 105 dyne
1 m = 100 cm
Thus, 1 Nm = 107 dyne cm
Solution 9 Correct option – c) negative work
The coolie has raised the load in upward direction i.e., displacement is in opposite
direction to that of force of gravity and when this is the case the work done by load is
negative. Thus, a negative work is done.

Solution 10 Correct option – b) light to chemical
The energy change during photosynthesis in plants is light energy to chemical energy.
Solution 11 Correct option – a)




As given in the question we can see that when the fulcrum is at 40 cm the left arm and
right arm both are in balanced position. So, when the fulcrum is moved to the centre of
scale which is 50 cm (i.e., to the right side of the scale) the left side will weigh more than
right and thus, left side will move in downward direction. Thus, correct option is a)

Solution 12
i) Correct option – b) centripetal force
A stone tied at end of a string is whirled by hand in a horizontal circle with uniform
speed. The force required for this circular motion is centripetal force.
ii) Correct option – a) towards the centre of the circular path
In the given case, the direction of force is towards the centre of the circular path.

Solution 13
i) Correct option – d) 20 J
The potential energy is given as,
P.E. = mgh
M = 200 g = 0.2 kg
g = 10 m/s2 (given), h = 10 m
P.E. = 0.2 × 10 × 10 = 20 J

ii) Correct option – b) 10 J
The potential energy at the highest point in this case, 15 m is
P.E. = mgh = 0.2 x 15 x 10 = 30 J
Potential energy at height 15 m is maximum and the kinetic energy is zero.
When body reaches 10 m, the potential energy become 20 J
According to law of conservation of energy, the kinetic energy at 10 m height will be
P.E. at height 15 m – P.E. at height 10 m = Gain in K.E. = 30 J – 20 J = 10 J
Thus, gain in K.E. until it reaches 10 m above ground is = 10 J

iii) Correct option – c) 30 J
The total energy at highest point i.e., 15 m is 30 J
According to law of conservation of energy the total energy at any point of its journey
during this freefall will remain same.
Thus, total energy of body when it is about to strike ground is 30 J.
iv) Correct option – c) 10√3
When the body will hit the ground the kinetic energy of this body will be maximum.
This means Kinetic energy at ground will be 30 J
We know,
K.E. = ½ mv2
            1                2
30              0 .2  v

    2       30  2
v                      300
                0 .2

v          300        3  100    3  25  4  10 3
Thus, velocity of the body with which it will hit the ground is 10√3 m/s

Solution 14 Correct option – d) 0.5
Load = 10 kgf = 100 N
Effort = 200 N
We know,
Mechanical advantage = Load/ Effort = 100/200 = 0.5
Solution 15 Correct option – a) it changes the direction of applied effort conveniently
A single fixed pulley is used because it changes the direction of applied effort
conveniently.

Solution 16 Correct option – b) 2
The velocity ratio of the arrangements of the pulley in which one is fixed and another one
is movable is 2.

Solution 17 Correct option – d) Power = Force × velocity
Power = Force x velocity is the correct mathematical relation.

Solution 18 Correct option – c) ultrasonic waves are used
In echo depth sounding, ultrasonic waves are used.

Solution 19 Correct option – c) Echo cardiogram
The diagnostic method which uses reflection of sound is echo cardiogram.

Solution 20
i) Correct option – b) 0.5 s
   The boy blows two whistles per second. That means time taken for one whistle is 0.5 s.
   The sound of whistling coincide with the echo and echo is heard only when whistling is
   stopped. This means the time in which the boy hears echo will be 0.5 s

ii) Correct option – d) 80 m
     We know,
     d = (v x t)/ 2 = (320 x 0.5)/2 = 160/2 = 80 m
iii) Correct option – b) 0.5 s
     When the speed of sound is increased by 16 m/s. The new speed becomes 336 m/s
     The boy moves 4 m away from the wall i.e., now he will be standing 84 m away from
     the wall.
     We know,
     d = (v x t)/2
     84 = (320 x t)/2
     84 = (336 x t)/ 2
     t = (84 x 2)/336 = 0.5 s

iv) Correct option – a) 0.05 s
    For the echo to be heard the minimum time must be 1/10th of the second i.e., 0.1 of
    second. So, the echo cannot be heard at 0.05 s.

Solution 21 Correct option – a) 1:1
When the light is travelling in a vacuum, the velocity of light of any wavelength is same.
Thus, ratio of velocities of light of wavelength 400nm and 800 nm in a vacuum is 1:1.
Solution 22 Correct option – b) 107
1 Joule = 107 erg

Solution 23
i)     Correct answer – b) Kinetic energy of body A is greater than kinetic energy of body
       B
Given that,
Momentum of body A, pA =Momentum of body B, pB
Mass of body A, mA < Mass of body B, mB
Hence the ratio of kinetic energy of body A and B are
            𝑝2
             𝐴
𝐾.𝐸𝐴       2𝑚𝐴       𝑚
       =    𝑝2
                 = 𝑚𝐵
𝐾.𝐸𝐵         𝐵        𝐴
           2𝑚𝐵
𝐾.𝐸𝐴                 𝑚
       > 1 … (∵ 𝑚𝐵 > 1)
𝐾.𝐸𝐵                     𝐴
∴ 𝐾. 𝐸𝐴 > 𝐾. 𝐸𝐵
Hence we can conclude that, kinetic energy of body A is greater than kinetic energy of
body B
ii)    Correct answer – c) 2:5
Given that,
𝐾.𝐸𝐴       5
       =2
𝐾.𝐸𝐵
Now we know the relation between kinetic energy and mass of body and it can be
expressed as
            𝑝2
             𝐴
𝐾.𝐸𝐴       2𝑚𝐴       𝑚
       =    𝑝2
                 = 𝑚𝐵
𝐾.𝐸𝐵         𝐵        𝐴
           2𝑚𝐵
  𝑚        5     𝑚
∴ 𝑚𝐵 = 2 ⇒ 𝑚𝐴 = 2: 5
      𝐴           𝐵



Solution 24
i)     Correct option – b) 47°
From the given figure we can see that angle of incidence i.e., the angle between incident
ray and normal is 47° along surface AB as we can see below.
Hence the angle of incidence at surface AB is 47° (i.e., AB =90° - 43°).




ii)    Correct option –c) The ray at the surface AD is travelling along the radius of
       curved part.
For the given case we know that light is incident on a curved surface of glass material.
Hence the ray will be travelling along the radius of curvature since light incident
perpendicular to curved surface will always travel towards its centre as shown below.




iii)  Correct option – a) 43°
From the given figure we can see that angle of incidence along surface BC will be 43° as
we can see below.




Alternate method:




Here for triangle FOE the angle of incidence i will be given as we can see below.
∠𝑖 = 180 − 47 − 90 = 43°
iv)    Correct option – a) 43°
As we can see from the given figure, when angle of incidence at surface BC is 43° the light
ray becomes parallel to surface BC.
Hence for the given case the angle of incidence is 43°.
Solution 25
i)     Correct option – d) 30°
From the given figure we can see that angle between incident ray and normal across
surface AC is 60°. Using this we can predict that angle A will be 30° and angle C will be
60° by using triangle sum theorem (i.e., ∠A+ ∠B+ ∠C=180°).




Hence the angle C of given prism will be 30°.
ii)   Correct option – b)




From the given data we know that, critical angle of prism is 42° and angle of incidence is
60°.
Thus, from this we can conclude that option c is incorrect since incident angle is greater
than critical angle (i.e., ∠i > ∠ic) which means light will undergo total internal reflection.
And from this given figure we can conclude that only option b is correct since for option a
incident angle is not equal to reflected ray and for option d light ray after refracting from
surface BC will bend away from normal not toward normal (∵ μg > μair).
