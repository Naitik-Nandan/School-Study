side drum. The frequency of vibration of medium particles is also very low compared to the side
drum.

(a)                                                                                      [3]
    (i) Define Calorimetry.
    (ii) Name the material used for making a Calorimeter.
    (iii) Why is a Calorimeter made up of thin sheets of the above material answered in (ii)?
(b)
    The melting point of naphthalene is 80 C and the room temperature is 30°C. A sample of
    liquid naphthalene at 100 C is cooled down to the room temperature.
    Draw a temperature time graph to represent this cooling. In the graph, mark the region
    which corresponds to the freezing process. [3]

(c)
       104 g of water at 30 C is taken in a calorimeter made of copper of mass 42g. When a
       certain mass of ice at 0 C is added to it, the final temperature of the mixture after the ice
       has melted, was found to be 10 C. Find the mass of ice added.
       [Specific heat capacity of water = 4.2 J g-1 oC-1; Specific latent heat of fusion of
                                                                                                       15

Solution 9:

(a) (i) The measurement of the quantity of heat is called calorimetry.
(ii) Copper.
(iii) Calorimeter made up of thin sheets of copper because copper is a good conductor of heat, the
vessel acquires the temperature of its contents quickly. Copper also has low specific heat;
therefore, a small amount of energy is needed to acquire that temperature.

(b) (i) BC represents the freezing process in the below graph:




(c) It is given that
mw = 104g,
Tw = 30oC
mc = 42 g,
T = 10oC
mi = ?

(b) (i) Nuclear fission is the process in which a heavy nucleus is split into two light nuclei of
nearly the same size, by bombarding it with slow neutrons.

(ii) 235     1     144     89        1




(c) (i) Needle deflects towards the east.
(ii) On passing the current in the wire AB, a magnetic field is produced around it and the
magnetic needle experiences a torque in this magnetic field, so it deflects to align itself in the
direction of the magnetic field at that point.
