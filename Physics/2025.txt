      2. B2 and B3 are in parallel. so, the combined          (iii) (a) The magnetic field is upward to downward
                                                                    direction. The direction of current is from left to
                       8´8                                          right. So, the rod PQ will experience a force towards
          resistance =        =4Ω
                       8+8                                          C. So, PQ will move towards C. The statement is
          This combination is in series with B1.                    true.
          Hence, equivalent resistance = 8 + 4 = 12 Ω          (b) Fleming’s left hand rule.
   (b) When B3 is removed, the circuit becomes:                 (c) If the replaced copper rod has same length but
                              B2                                    greater cross-sectional area then the resistance of
                 B1                                                 this rod will be lower than the previous rod. So, the
                                                                    current through the new rod will be more than the
