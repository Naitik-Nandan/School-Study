                           Section - A (40 Marks)
                    (Attempt all questions from this section)

Question 1:
Choose the correct answers to the questions from the given options.      [15]
[15 Marks]
(Do not copy the questions, write the correct answers only.)

(i) Clockwise moment produced by a force about a fulcrum is considered to be:
    (a) Positive
    (b) Negative
    (c) Zero
    (d) None of these
Ans: b. Negative
If the effect of the body is to turn it clockwise the moment of force is called
clockwise and it is taken negative.

(ii) When the speed of a moving object is doubled, then its kinetic energy.
     (a) remains the same
     (b) Decreases
     (c) is doubled
     (d) becomes four times
Ans: d. Becomes four times
If v becomes 2v, then
        1       2    4    2
𝐾𝐸 = 2 𝑚(2𝑣) = 2 𝑚𝑣
= 4 times the initial Kinetic Energy.
Therefore, when the object's speed doubles, its kinetic energy doubles to four
times the initial kinetic energy.

(iii) The energy conversion in a washing machine is from
     (a) magnetic to electrical
     (b) electrical to mechanical
     (c) electrical to magnetic
     (d) magnetic to electrical
Ans: b. Electrical to mechanical
In a washing machine, electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy.

(iv) Which of the following radiations suffers maximum deflection in a magnetic
field?
    (a) Alpha radiations
    (b) Beta radiations
    (c) Gamma radiations
    (d) X-radiations
Ans:The correct option is (b) Beta radiations
Gamma radiations and X-rays are both electromagnetic waves, and they cannot
deflect in an electric or magnetic field.
The deflection of Beta radiations is more than that of Alpha radiations since a
β-particle has charge density higher than that of α-particle.
(v) Speed of blue light in water is:
    (a) more than green light
    (b) more than orange light
    (c) more than violet light
    (d) more than red light
Ans: The correct option is (c) more than violet light
The wavelength of light is directly proportional to the speed of light in the
medium. This means that the greater the wavelength of light, greater will be the
speed of light.As we know that, the wavelength of blue light is greater than the
wavelength of violet light. Therefore, the speed of blue light will be greater than
the violet light.

(vi) A concave lens produces only ____________ image.
    (a) real, enlarged
    (b) virtual, enlarged
    (c) virtual, diminished
    (d) real, diminished
Ans: (c) virtual, diminished
A concave lens always diverge light rays and it always produces virtual,
diminished image.

(vii). When a body vibrates under a periodic force, the vibrations of the body are
always:
     (a) natural vibrations
     (b) damped vibrations
     (c) forced vibrations
     (d) resonant vibrations
Ans: c. forced vibrations
The vibrations of a body which take place under the influence of an external
periodic force acting on it, are called the forced vibrations. When the external
periodic force is applied to the vibrating body, the body gradually acquires the
frequency of the applied periodic force

(viii). Two notes are produced from two different musical instruments, such that
they have the same loudness and same pitch. The produced notes differ in their.
        (a) Waveform
        (b) Frequency
       (c) Wavelength
       (d) Speed
Ans. (a) Waveform
Quality is used to describe the quality of the waveform as it appears to the
listener. Therefore the quality of a note depends upon the waveform. Two notes
of the same pitch and loudness, played from different instruments do not sound
the same because the waveforms are different and therefore differ in quality or
tone

(ix) When a current I flows through a wire of resistance R for time t then the
electrical energy produced is given by:
       (a) I2Rt
       (b) IR2t
       (c) IRt
       (d) IRt2
Ans. (a) I2Rt
According to Joule , the heat produced by an electric current I flowing through a
resistance R for a time t is proportional to I2Rt

(x). Choose the correct relation for e.m.f (ε) and terminal voltageV:
    (a) ε = v (always)
    (b) V > ε (always)
    (c) V < ε (When the cell is in use)
    (d) None of these

    (b) Increases
    (c) Remains the same
    (d) First increase then decreases
Ans.(b) Increases
The strength of the magnetic field is always proportional to the magnitude of
current flowing. Hence, when the current increases, the magnetic field also
increases.

Question. 2
(i)                                                                              [3]
    (a) When does the nucleus of an atom tend to become radioactive?
    (b) Name a single pulley in which displacement of load and effort is not the
        same.
    (c) State one advantage of this pulley.
Ans.
    (a) When the number of neutrons becomes greater than protons, then the
        nucleus of that atom becomes radioactive.
    (b) A differential pulley, also known as a chain hoist or chain block, is a type
        of pulley system where the displacement of the load and the effort are not
        the same.
    (c) One advantage of a differential pulley system is that it allows for a smaller
        effort to lift a heavier load.

(ii)                                                                              [2]
  (a) What is the position of the centre of gravity of a triangular lamina?
  (b) When this triangular lamina is suspended freely from any one vertex, what
      is the moment of force produced by its own weight in its rest position?
Ans:
  (a) For triangular lamina, the centre of gravity lies at the point of intersection of
      its medians.




       (b) When a triangular lamina is suspended freely from any one of its vertices,
           it comes to rest in a position where the weight vector is aligned with the
           vertical line passing through the suspended vertex. At this point, the lamina
      is in rotational equilibrium, which means that the sum of the moments of all
      external forces acting on the lamina is zero


(iii) The diagram shows wheel O pivoted at point A. Three equal forces F1, F2
and F3 act at point B on the wheel.                                        [2]




(a) Which force will produce maximum moment about A?
Ans: The force F1 will produce the maximum moment about A

(b) Give a reason for your answer in (a).
Ans: The moment produced by a force is given by the magnitude of the force
multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the point of application of the force
to the pivot point. In this case, the perpendicular distance from the line of action
of F1(Tangential force) to the pivot point A is equal to the Diameter of the wheel,
while the perpendicular distance from line of action of F2 and F3 is less than the
diameter Therefore, the moment produced by force F1 will be greater than the
moments produced by forces F2 and F3, since F1 has the largest perpendicular
distance from the pivot point A. Thus, force F1 will produce the maximum
moment about A.

(iv)                                                                         [2]
    (a) What should be the angle between the direction of force and the direction
       of displacement ,for work to be negative?
    (b) Name the physical quantity obtained using the formula U/h, where U is
       the potential energy and h is the height.
Ans: (a) The angle should be 1800 between force and displacement, for the work
to be Negative
     (b) This formula gives the amount of potential energy possessed by an
object per unit height above a reference point due to the gravitational force
between the object and the Earth. This quantity is the weight of the object.

(v) Calculate the power spent by crane while lifting a load of mass 2000 kg,at
                               2
velocity of 1.5 m/s (g = 10 m𝑠 )                                               [2]
                𝑊    𝑓. 𝑑
Ans. Power =    𝑡
                    = 𝑡 = 𝑚𝑔𝑣 = 2000 × 10 × 1. 5 = 30000 W


(vi) A metal foot ruler is held at the edge of a table. It is pressed at its free end
and then released. It vibrates.
(a) Name the vibrations produced.
(b) State one way to increase the frequency of these vibrations.                [2]

Ans:
a) The vibrations produced are known as free vibrations or natural vibrations
b) To increase the frequency of these vibrations, one way is to reduce the length
of the ruler. This can be done by placing the ruler partially off the table so that a
shorter length of the ruler is free to vibrate. The shorter the length of the ruler, the
higher the frequency of its natural vibrations

(vii) ‘A geyser is rated 240 W -220 V’. Explain the meaning of this statement.

Ans: If a geyser is rated at Power equal to 240 W and voltage is equal to 220 volts it
means that it consumes 240 W of power when 220 volts of voltage is applied to it
and the current which it draws will be equal to I is equal to power upon volts so I
will be equal to 1.09 A when the geyser is connected to 220 volts of supply it
draws a current of 1.09 ampere and consumes 240 W.

Question 3                                                         [ 2 marks each]
(i)
    a. Is it possible for a concave lens to form an image of size two times that of
       the object? Write Yes or No.
    b. What will happen to the focal length of the lens if a part of the lens is
       covered with an opaque paper?
Ans:
       a. No, because concave lens always produces a diminished image
       b. When half of the convex lens is covered with an opaque paper, the rays of
          light occurs and image will be formed as how the normal lens receives,
          which means that the focal length remains the same, but, only the
          brightness or intensity of the light will be diminished due to the covering of
          opaque paper.

(ii)
   (a) Which electrical component protects the electric circuit in case of excess
       current and which can also be used as a switch?
   (b) Name the wire to which this electrical component is connected in an
       electric circuit.
Ans:
(a)MCBs protect the electric circuit in case of excess current .MCBs are
switches that turn off automatically when there is an overload or a short circuit.
After solving the problem in the circuit, the switch can be turned back on, and
then the current flows as usual.

(b) A MCB is connected in series with the main line (live wire) in the household
circuit.

(iii) A copper conductor is placed over two stretched copper wires whose ends
are connected to a D.C. supply as shown in the diagram.
   (a) What should be the magnetic poles at the points A and B lying on either
      side of the conductor to experience the force in the upward direction?

Ans:To make the points A and B lying on either side of the conductor experience
the force in the upward direction, the magnetic poles at A and B should be of
opposite polarity. Specifically, the pole at point A should be North (N) and the
pole at point B should be South (S).

   (b) Name the law used to find these polarity

Ans: The law used to find these polarities is the Fleming's left-hand rule for dc
electric motors. This rule relates the direction of the force on a current-carrying
conductor in a magnetic field to the direction of the current and the direction of
magnetic field.

(iv)Thermal capacities of substances A and B are the same. If mass of A is more
than mass of B then:
    (a) Which substances will have more specific heat capacity?
        Ans.
        Q = mcΔT
                                ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦
      specific heat capacity = 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦
      Thermal capacities of substances A and B are same and,
      Since the mass of A is more than mass B, so
      The substance B will have more specific heat capacity

   (b) Which substances will show greater rise in temperature if the same amount
       of heat is supplied to both?
       Ans.
       Q = mcΔT
       If Thermal capacities of substances A and B are same Then
                  1
      ΔT ∝ 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦
      Sincs mass of A is more than mass B
      so substance B will show greater rise in temperature
(v) How is the radioactivity of a radioisotope affected if it undergoes a chemical
change? Give a reason for your answer.

Ans:
Radioactivity of an element is not affected by the chemical change as
radioactivity is a nuclear phenomenon and doesn't involve extranuclear electrons.

               (Attempt any four questions from this sections)

Question 4:

(i) The diagram below shows the ray OP travelling through an equilateral prism of
a certain material.                                                          [3]
    (a) Calculate the value of i2, if the angle of deviation is 43°.
    (b) What is the ray QS called?




Ans:
  a. We know that angle of deviation is given as
     δ=𝑖+𝑒−𝐴
     Where i = angle of incidence, e = angle of emergence, and
     A = Angle of prism, A = 600 for an equilateral prism.
     Given δ = 430 , i = 650 and i2= e
     Substituting the values we get:
     i2 = δ + A - i = 430 + 600 - 650 = 380
   b. The ray QS is called the emergent ray.

(ii) Copy the diagram given below and complete the path of the light ray PQ, as it
emerges out of the prism by marking necessary angles. The critical angle of
glass is 42°.                                                                 [3]




Ans:




iii)The diagram below shows two parallel rays A (Orange) & B (Blue) Incident
from air , on air-glass boundary                                        [4]
(a) Copy and complete the path rays of A and B

Ans.the refractive index of glass is less for Orange light, while it is more for Blue
light (µ𝑂 < µ𝐵), So Orange ray is deviated less while the blue is deviated more i.e.
angle of refraction 𝑟1 for Orange is more than angle of refraction 𝑟2for Blue ray.




(b) How do the speed of these rays differ in glass

Ans.Since the refractive index of glass is less for Orange light, while it is more for
Blue light (µ𝑂 < µ𝐵)in glass, the orange light travels faster than blue light.


(c) Are the two refracted rays in glass parallel?Give reason

Ans. The two refracted rays inside glass are not parallel. The reason is that the
speed of orange light in glass is more, while it is less for the blue light, so the
orange ray bends less, while the blue ray bends more (i.e.,angle of refraction 𝑟1
for Orange is more than angle of refraction 𝑟2for Blue ray. )
Question 5:
(i) A convex lens of focal length 10 cm is placed at a distance of 60 cm from a
screen. How far from the lens should an object be placed so as to obtain a real
image on the screen?                                                     [3]

(ii)                                                                          [3]
       a. A coin kept inside water [𝝻 =4/3] when viewed from air in a vertical
          direction appears to be raised by 3.0 mm. Find the depth of the coin in
          water.
       b. How is the critical angle related to the refractive index of a medium?

(iii)                                                                         [4]
     a. Infrared radiations are used in warfare. Explain with reason, why?
     b. A ray of light is incident at 45° on an equilateral prism in the diagram
        below.




       1. Name the phenomenon exhibited by the ray of light when it enters and
          emerges out of the prism.
       2. State the cause of the above phenomenon mentioned by you.

Ans
(i) Given data

Distance of the image from the lens v = 60 cm
Distance of object from the lens, u = ?
The focal length of the lens, f = 10 cm

Using the lens formula we get,
1    1    1
𝑓
   = 𝑣 − 𝑢
1      1    1
10
    = 60 − 𝑢
1     1     1
𝑢
   = 60 − 10
1    1−6
𝑢
   = 60
1    −1
𝑢
   = 12
u = - 12 cm
The negative sign shows that the distance is measured in the opposite direction
of the incident light.
The lens should be placed at 12 cm to obtain a real image.

(ii)                                                                          [3]
                        4
        a. Given µ = 3 ,
           And the shift = 3 mm

           Let the real depth be x mm, then
                                𝑥   𝑥       3𝑥
           Apparent depth = µ =     4   =   4
                                    3

           Shift = real depth - apparent depth
                   3𝑥       𝑥
           =𝑥−     4
                        = 4 = 3 𝑚𝑚 ⇒ 𝑥 = 3 × 4 = 12 𝑚𝑚
        b. The ratio of velocities of a light ray in the air to the given medium is a
           refractive index. Thus, the relation between the critical angle and refractive
           index can be established as the Critical angle is inversely proportional to
           the refractive index.

           𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝐶 = µ


(iii)                                                                           [4]
        a. Infrared radiations are used as signals during the war as they are not
           visible and they are not absorbed much in the medium. Ordinary visible
           light is scattered by haze but infrared (IR) radiation can penetrate through
      the haze without being scattered. Therefore, these can be used as signals
      on distant objects obscured by atmospheric haze.

   b.
   1. When white light ray passes through a prism, it disperses into seven
      different colours, and this phenomenon is called dispersion.
   2. When white light passes through a glass prism, its constituent colours (red,
      orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) travel with different speeds in
      the prism because the refractive index is colour dependent. This causes
      the dispersion of light.

At equilibrium : Anti-clockwise movement = Clockwise movement
                 (40 - 0) × 𝑊1 = (100 - 40) × 𝑊2
                  40 𝑊1 = 60 𝑊2
                   40 ( 50 - 𝑊2) = 60 𝑊2
                      2000 - 40𝑊2 = 60 𝑊2
                      2000 = 100𝑊2
                       𝑊2 = 20gf
𝑊1 = 50 gf - 𝑊2 = 50gf - 20gf = 30gf
When ruler is cut at centre then weight of part [ 0 to 50 cm] is:
                 10                   20
𝑊3 = 𝑊1 +        60
                      𝑊2 = 30 gf +    6
                                           gf = 33.33 gf
Weight of part [ 50 to 100 cm] is:
𝑊4 = 50 gf - 33.33 gf = 16.66 gf.
So the part [ 0 to 50 cm] of the ruler will weigh more.

(b) When the ruler is pivoted at centre, then let the required weight to balance the
ruler be 𝑊5. Since, the weight of [50 to 100 cm] side is less, so the required
weight has to be placed at [50 to 100 cm] side.
At equilibrium,
 Anti-clockwise movement = Clockwise movement
[50 - 0] × 𝑊3 = [100 - 50] × [ 𝑊4 + 𝑊5]
50 × 33. 33 = 50 × [ 16. 66 + 𝑊5 ]
𝑊5 = 33. 33 − 16. 66 = 16. 66 𝑔𝑓.

Question 7
(i)                                                                         [3]
    (a) Which characteristic of sound is affected due to the larger surface of a
school bell?
Ans: The larger surface area of a school bell can affect the amplitude or
loudness of the sound produced by the bell. When the surface area of a bell is
increased, it allows for a larger amount of air to be displaced when the bell is
struck, resulting in a larger sound wave and a louder sound. However, it's
important to note that other factors such as the shape and material of the bell can
also affect the sound it produces.

  (b) Calculate the distance covered by the Ultrasonic wave having a velocity of
1.5 kms-1 in 14 s, when it is received after reflection by the receiver of the
SONAR.

Ans: The distance covered by the ultrasonic wave can be calculated using the
formula:

Distance = Velocity × Time

Here, the velocity of the ultrasonic wave is given as 1.5 km/s, and the time taken
for it to travel to the target and back (i.e., round-trip time) is 14 s. Since the wave
travels to the target and back, the actual distance covered will be half of the total
distance travelled by the wave. So, we can calculate the distance covered by the
ultrasonic wave as follows:

Distance = (Velocity × Time) / 2
= (1.5 km/s × 14 s) / 2
= 10.5 km

Therefore, the distance covered by the ultrasonic wave is 10.5 km when it is
received after reflection by the receiver of the SONAR.

(ii) (a) Complete the following nuclear changes:                                 [3]
        238         4           0
           92P → Q + 2He →R + -1e
Nuclear reaction was accompanied with release of a particle having mass
number and atomic number equal to 4 and 2 respectively. Hence emitted atom is
an alpha particle.

 238
     U→ 23490Th + 42He+ energy
    92



Secondly parent nucleus Q changes into daughter nucleus
R due to beta decay. When a beta particle is emitted, the atomic number
increases by 1 but the mass number of the parent nuclei remains the same.

 234
     Th→ 23491Pa + 0-1e
    90



     (b) Name the nuclear radiation which has the highest ionising power.
Ans: Alpha particles have the highest ionisation power than the other two types
of radiation owing to the fact that an α-particle is doubly ionised helium nucleus,
i.e. He2+

(iii) We are able to see the T.V. channels clearly when we set T.V. on
auto-tuning.                                                                    [4]

(a) Which phenomenon led to the clear visibility of the channels, due to
auto-tuning?
Ans: The phenomenon that led to the clear visibility of the channels due to
auto-tuning is called Resonance

b) Define the above phenomenon mentioned by you.
Ans : Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when an object is subjected to an
external force at its natural frequency, causing it to vibrate with a large amplitude.
In the context of TV channels, the phenomenon of resonance is not directly
related to the clear visibility of TV channels due to auto-tuning.
However, resonance can occur in TV antennas, which are used to receive TV
signals from broadcasting stations. When a TV antenna is tuned to the frequency
of a particular TV channel, the antenna can resonate with the frequency of the
TV signal, amplifying the signal and improving the reception quality
(c) Give any one more example of this phenomenon.
Ans: Another example of resonance is in musical instruments, where the natural
frequencies of the instrument's components, such as strings or air columns, can
resonate with the applied force of the musician playing the instrument, creating
the characteristic sound of the instrument

Question 8
(i) (a)Define specific resistance                                            [3]
Ans.Specific resistance is defined as "the resistance offered per unit length and
unit cross-section area of that material when a known quantity of voltage applied
at its end ''.
     𝑅. 𝑎
ρ=    𝑙
The SI unit of specific resistance is Ohm-m.

(b)What happens to the specific resistance of a conductor if it’s length is
Doubled
Ans.The specific resistance resistance of a conductor is inversely proportional to
                      1
its length (l) as ρ ∝ 𝑙 .
The specific resistance of a conductor would be decreased by 2 times or halved,
if the length of the conductor is doubled.


(c)Name a substance whose specific resistance remains almost
 unchanged with increase in it’s temperature
Ans.The resistance of alloys like german-silver, Manganin, Constantan practically
does not change with rise in temperature.

(ii) (a)Which nuclear radiation will travel undeviated in an electric field?  [3]
Ans. Gama radiations will travel undeviated in an electric field
     (b) How can one stop the radiations escaping from a nuclear reactor
      in a nuclear power plant?
Ans. The steel containment vessel serves as a barrier to prevent leakage of any
radioactive gases or fluids from the plant. An outer concrete building serves as
the final layer, protecting the steel containment vessel.
     (c) Name one internal source of background radiation.
Ans. All people have internal radiation, mainly from radioactive potassium-40
and carbon-14 inside their bodies from birth.

(iii) Find the value of current I drawn from cell.                     [4]




  (a) Calculate the current I
Ans.




      Both R2 and R3 are in series hence their combine resistance is 15Ω+15Ω
      = 30Ω
      R2,R3 (30Ω) and R1(30Ω) are parallel
      Hence combine resistance will be 30/2 = 15 Ω
      Total resistance of circuit = 15 Ω + 2 Ω = 17 Ω
               𝑒.𝑚.𝑓        3.4
      I = 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = 17 = 0. 2 𝐴


   (b) Calculate the terminal voltage
       Terminal voltage V = emf−Ir
                    = 3.4 - (0.2)(2)
                    =3.4 - 0.4
                    =3V
Question 9
(i) Calculate the total amount of heat energy required to melt 200 g of ice at
0°C to water at 100°C.
                                    −1
(Specific latent heat of ice 336 J 𝑔
                                            −1   −1
Specific heat capacity of water = -4.2 J 𝑔 C       )                    [3]

(ii) (a) State the principle of calorimetry.
  (b) Name the material used for making a calorimeter.
  (c) Write one characteristic property of the material chosen for making a
Calorimeter.                                                         [3]

(iii) The diagram below shows a cardboard on which iron filings are kept. A wire
bent in the form of a loop is seen passing through the cardboard. When current
flows through it the iron filings arrange themselves as shown below.




   (a) State the polarities of the battery at A and B
   (b) State the effect on the magnetic field if an iron is held along the axis of the
       coil.
   (c) State one way to
       1. Change the polarity of the coil
       2. Decrease the strength of the magnetic field around the coil. [4]

Ans:

(i) Heat required = latent heat for conversion of ice to water+heat required to
raise the water temperature by 100℃
Q = mcΔT for temperature change in same phase
Q = mL for phase change at the same temperature.
Given, Mass of ice = 200g,
                        −1     −1
           𝐶𝑊 = 4.2 J 𝑔        𝐾
                          −1
            𝐿𝑖 = 336 J 𝑔

Amount of heat energy gained by 200g of ice at 0℃ to convert into water
= 200 × 336 = 67200 J

Amount of heat energy gained when temp. of 200g of water at 0°C rise to 100℃
= 200 × 4.2 × 100
= 84000 J
                                                                                           5
∴ Total amount of heat energy gained (Q) = 67200 + 84000 = 1.512 × 10 J

(ii)
        (a) The principle of calorimetry (or principle of mixtures) states that for an insulated system,
            heat energy lost by the hot body is equal to the heat energy gained by the cold body.
            𝑚1𝑐1(𝑡1 − 𝑡 ) = 𝑚2𝑐2(𝑡 − 𝑡2)

        (b) Calorimeters are made of copper.Copper has a small Specific Heat Capacity and the
            thin box ensures that the box has small heat capacity. Thus the calorimeter box can
            absorb a small amount of heat from the contents of the calorimeter.

        (c) Calorimeters are made of copper because copper is a good heat conductor, has a low
            specific heat capacity, and a light copper wall receives/delivers negligible heat. Cu has a
            moderate specific heat capacity, so it immediately leads the equilibrium temperature by
            absorbing a small amount of heat.

(iii)
        (a) A is +ve terminal and B is -ve terminal. At A current is upward so magnetic
           field line is anti-clockwise and it has north polarity. At B current is
           downward so magnetic field line is clockwise and it has south polarity.
 (b) If an iron is held along the axis of the coil, the strength of the magnetic field
     is increased.
(C)
 (1) The polarity of the coil can be changed by reversing the direction of the
     current.
 (2) The strength of the magnetic field around the coil can be decreased by
     decreasing the current which can be achieved by increasing the
     resistance.
