             SECTION-A (40 Marks) (Attempt all questions from this Section.)

Q1. Choose the correct answer to the questions from the given options. (Do not copy the
questions. Write the correct answer only.)

1.1. When a bell fixed on a cycle rings, then the energy conversion that takes place is
______.

   1. Gravitational potential energy to sound energy.
   2. Kinetic energy to sound energy.
   3. Sound energy to electrical energy.
   4. Sound energy to mechanical energy.

Solution

When a bell fixed on a cycle rings, then the energy conversion that takes place is kinetic
energy to sound energy.
Explanation:

This is because ringing a bell typically requires moving a bell component, like a lever or
clapper. Mechanical forces initially move these components. This mechanical force is
converted into kinetic energy as the clapper moves, and this kinetic energy is then
converted into sound energy when it strikes the bell.

1.2. A door lock is opened by turning the lever (handle) of length 0.2 m. If the moment of
force produced is 1 Nm, then the minimum force required is ______.

   1. 5 N
   2. 10 N
   3. 20 N
   4. 0.2 N

Solution

A door lock is opened by turning the lever (handle) of length 0.2 m. If the moment of
force produced is 1 Nm, then the minimum force required is 5 N.

Explanation:




1.3. A force 'F' moves a load from A to C as shown in the figure below. For the calculation
of the work done, which of these lengths would you use as the displacement?




   1. 3m

   2. 4m
     3. 5m

     4. 7m

Solution

5m

Explanation:

As displacement in the direction of force is used.

1.4. A radioactive nucleus containing 128 nucleons emits a β-particle. After β- emission
the number of nucleons present in the nucleus will be ______.

     1. 128

     2. 129

     3. 124

     4. 127

Solution

A radioactive nucleus containing 128 nucleons emits a β-particle. After β- emission the
number of nucleons present in the nucleus will be 128.

Explanation:

A neutron undergoes β-decay, converting it into a proton and releasing a β-particle. As a
result, the mass number stays constant while the atomic number increases by 1.
Therefore, there will still be 128 nucleons (the mass number).

1.5. Assertion (A): Ultraviolet radiations is scattered more as compared to the microwave
radiations.

Reason (R): Wavelength of ultraviolet radiation is more than the wavelength of
microwave radiation.

     1. Both A and Rare true.

     2. A is true but R is false.

     3. A is false but R is true.
   4. Both A and Rare false.

Solution

A is true but R is false.

Explanation:

Because UV radiation has shorter wavelengths than microwave radiation, it scatters
more.

1.6. When the stem of vibrating tuning fork is pressed on a table, the tabletop starts
vibrating. These vibrations are definitely an example of ______.

   1. Resonance

   2. Natural vibrations

   3. Forced vibrations

   4. Damped vibrations

Solution

When the stem of vibrating tuning fork is pressed on a table, the tabletop starts
vibrating. These vibrations are definitely an example of Forced vibrations.

Explanation:

This occurs because the tuning fork forces the tabletop to vibrate at its own frequency.

fulcrum are where the effort is applied.

1.8. The specific resistance of a conductor depends on its ______.

     1. Length

     2. Material

     3. Area of cross section

     4. Radius

Solution

The specific resistance of a conductor depends on its material.

______.

     1. Terminal voltage
   2. Electro motive force

   3. Voltage drop

   4. None of these

Solution

The potential difference between terminals of a cell in a closed electric circuit is Electro
motive force.

Explanation:

This is so because the potential difference between its electrodes when current is pulled
from them is known as the terminal voltage. Because when charge flows in a circuit, it is
always less than the e.m.f.

   1. Energy is released and temperature remains constant.

   2. Energy is absorbed and temperature remains constant.

   3. Energy is released and temperature decreases.

   4. Energy is absorbed and temperature increases.

Solution

During melting of ice at 0°C the energy is absorbed and temperature remains constant.

Explanation:

The latent heat of fusion causes energy to be absorbed during ice melting at 0°C,
maintaining a constant temperature.

1.12. Linear magnification (m) produced by a concave lens is ______.

   1. m < 1

   2. m > l

   3. m = 1

   4. m = 2
Solution

Linear magnification (m) produced by a concave lens is m < 1.

Explanation:

Because an object appears smaller in the image created by a concave lens.

1.13. A radioactive element is placed in an evacuated chamber. Then the rate of
radioactive decay will ______.

   1. Decrease

   2. Increase

   3. Remain unchanged

   4. Depend on the surrounding temperature

Solution

A radioactive element is placed in an evacuated chamber. Then the rate of radioactive
decay will remain unchanged.

Explanation:

The properties of the atom's nucleus, not external factors, determine an element's rate
of radioactive decay.

1.15. A block of glass is pushed into the path of the light as shown below. Then the
converging point x will:




   1. Move away from the slab.

   2. Move towards the slab.

   3. Not shift.

   4. Move towards the left side of the lens.

Solution

Move away from the slab.

Explanation:

As light travelling through glass bends towards the glass slab, the point of convergence
or focus will move away from the normal, and light will converge at a location away from
the glass slab in the direction of the light after emerging in the air.
Q2.

on.

2.1. (b) Name the class of the lever shown in the picture below:




Solution

The simple machine shown in the figure is a bottle opener. It is a class II lever, as it
always acts as a force multiplier.

2.2. (a) When a stone tied to a string is rotated in a horizontal plane, the tension in the
string provides ______ force necessary for circular motion.

Solution

When a stone tied to a string is rotated in a horizontal plane, the tension in the string
provides centripetal force necessary for circular motion.

2.2. (b) Work done by this force at any instant is ______.

Solution

Work done by this force at any instant is zero.

2.3. A non uniform beam of weight 120 N pivoted at one end is shown in the diagram
below. Calculate the value of F to keep the beam in equilibrium.
Solution

To balance the beam with a weight of 120 N, force F is applied.

∴ Anticlockwise moment = Clockwise moment




2.4. (a) Meera chose to use a block and tackle system of '9' pulleys instead of a single
movable pulley to lift a heavy load.

What is the advantage of using a block and tackle system over a single movable pulley?

Solution

The single movable pulley is better for the block and tackle system because the effort
multiplies by '9' times, where the total number of the system's pulleys serves as a force
multiplier as a result. As stated differently, she gains greater mechanical benefits.

2.4. (b) Meera chose to use a block and tackle system of '9' pulleys instead of a single
movable pulley to lift a heavy load.

Why should she connect more number of pulleys in the upper fixed block?

Solution

In the upper fixed block, she adds extra pulleys to increase the mechanical advantage.
2.5. Sumit does 600 J of work in 10 min and Amit does 300 J of work in 20 min. Calculate
the ratio of the powers delivered by them.

Solution

Sumit: Work done, w1 = 600 J

Time taken, t1 = 10 min = 600 sec




Amit: Work done, w2 = 300 J

Time taken, t2 = 20 min = 1200 sec




2.6. 5 bulbs are connected in series in a room. One bulb is fused. It is removed and
remaining 4 bulbs are again connected in series to the same circuit. What will be the
effect on the following physical quantities?

(Increases, Decreases, Remain Same).
   a. Resistance
   b. Intensity of light

Solution

   a. When one lightbulb is removed, the circuit's overall resistance falls because the
      equivalent resistance in a series is equal to the sum of all the resistances.

   b. More current will flow through the circuit, and the light's intensity will rise as the
      electric circuit's resistance falls.

2.7. Rohan conducted experiments on echo in different media. He observed that a
minimum distance of 'x' meters is required for the echo to be heard in oxygen and 'y'
meters in benzene. Compare 'x' and 'y'. Justify your answer.

Solution




Q3.

3.1. (a) In a reading glass what is the position of the object with respect to the convex
lens used?
Solution

The object is positioned between the lens's focus and pole while using a reading glass.
This enables the thing to be magnified.

3.1. (b) In a reading glass what is the position of the object with respect to the concave
lens used?

Why can't we use the concave lens to position the object in the reading glass?

Solution

A concave lens is a diverging lens that constantly forms a virtual, diminished picture.
Therefore, using it for magnification was not possible.

3.2. A fuse is rated 5 A. Can it be used with a geyser rated 1540 W, 220 V Write Yes or No.
Give supporting calculations to justify your answer.

Solution

Here, power of geyser is P = 1540 W

Voltage, V = 220 V

Now, P = VI




Because a geyser pulls more current than the fuse can handle, a 5A fuse will blow if used
with one. No, you cannot use a 5A fuse.

3.3. State two factors affecting the coil's rotation speed in a D.C. motor.

Solution

The factors that affect the speed of rotation of the coil in a D.C. motor are:

   c. Strength of magnetic field.

   d. Area of the coil.

3.4. How much heat is required to convert 500 g of ice at 0°C to water at 0°C? The latent
heat of fusion of ice is 330 Jg-1.

Solution

Here, mass of ice (m) = 500 g

Latent heat of ice (L) = 330 J/g

Heat required (Q) = mL

= 500 × 330 J

= 165000 J

= 165 kJ

By using lens formula




4.2. Below is an incomplete table showing the arrangement of electromagnetic spectrum
in the increasing order of their wavelength. Complete the table:

 Gamma ray X - ray UV rays Visible rays Infrared A Radio waves


      a. Identify the radiation A.
      b. Name the radiation used to detect fracture in bones.
      c. Name one property common to both A and Radio waves.

Solution

   a. Microwaves

   b. X-rays

   c. Due to their long wavelengths, both microwaves and radio waves are used in
      long-distance communication.
4.3. (a) Why do we use red colour as a danger signal on the top of a skyscraper?

Solution

Since red has the longest wavelength of all the colours that make up visible light, it is
least dispersed by atmospheric air molecules and may therefore travel farther or be seen
more clearly from a distance.

4.3. (b) The diagram below shows the path of a blue ray through the prism:

   1. Calculate the critical angle of the material of the prism for blue colour.

   2. What is the measure of the angle of this prism (A)?

   3. Which colour should replace the blue ray, for the ray to undergo Total Internal
      Reflection?




Solution




1. Here, the refracted ray PQ is normal to the surface AB of the prism (i.e., ∠r = 0°), so
the incident ray at the point P should also be normal to the surface AB so that ∠i = 0°. At
point Q, the angle of incidence for the ray PQ is 133° - 90° = 43°.

Now this angle should be equal to the critical angle because ray PQ is refracted at 90°,
i.e., it is refracted along QC.

Hence, the critical angle of the prism is 43°.

2. In ΔAPQ

∠APQ + ∠PQA + ∠PAQ = 180°
90° + 47° + ∠PAQ = 180°

∠PAQ = 180° - 90° - 47°

∠PAQ = 43°

∴ ∠A = 43°

3. The light used and its wavelength determine the angle of deviation. With a decrease in
the light wavelength, the angle of deviation increases.

Accordingly, the beam will experience total internal reflection if we swap out the blue
light for intense light, sometimes known as indigo light.

Q5.

5.1.




Solution
5.2. (a) Light travels a distance of '10x' units in time 't1' in vacuum and it travels a
distance of 'x' units in time 't2' in a denser medium.

Using this information answer the question that follows:

'Light covers a distance of '20x' units in time 't1' in diamond'. State true or false.

   1. True

   2. False

Solution

This statement is False.

Reason:

Because light always travels slower in a medium than it does in a vacuum. Within a
vacuum, light travels 10x units over time 't1'. Therefore, it is impossible to travel '20x'
units in time 't1' in a diamond.

5.2. (b) Light travels a distance of '10x' units in time 't1' in vacuum and it travels a
distance of 'x' units in time 't2' in a denser medium. Using this information answer the
question that follows:

Calculate the refractive index of the medium in terms of 't1' and 't2'.

Solution

Given that light travels a distance 10x units,

Time taken = t1




We know that,

Refractive index of medium
5.3. A monochromatic ray of light is incident on an equilateral prism placed at minimum

Solution

a.




b. Factors on which the angle of deviation depends are:

             1. Angle of incidence (i).
             2. Material of the prism (μ).
             3. Angle of the prism.
             4. the colour or wavelength (λ) of light used.
             5. refractive index.

Q6.

6.1. (a) Define the centre of gravity of a body.

Define Centre of Gravity.

Solution




6.2. Two identical marbles A and B are rolled down along Path 1 and Path 2 respectively.

Path 1 is frictionless and Path 2 is rough.

   a. Which marble will surely reach the next peak?

   b. Along which path/s the mechanical energy will be conserved?

   c. Along which path/s is the law of conservation of energy obeyed?
Solution

   a. Path 2 is rough, and Path 1 is frictionless. Because there will be no energy lost on
      the frictionless road, marble A will undoubtedly reach the top.\

   b. Total mechanical energy = kinetic energy (k) + potential energy (u)

When there is no frictional force, it remains constant; hence, mechanical energy will be
preserved along path 1.

   c. Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, the law of conservation of energy
      applies to both scenarios.

   1. Mechanical Advantage.

   2. Effort needed to lift the load.




Solution

Here, load, L = 48 kgf

Efficiency = 80% = 0.8




Q7.

7.1. (a) Name the waves used in SONAR.

Solution
Ultrasonic waves.

7.1. (b) In the above diagram Lata stands between two cliffs and claps her hands.

Determine the time taken by her to hear the first echo. Speed of sound in air 320 ms-1.




Solution




The closest cliff produces the first echo. However, the first cliff, or cliff A, is only 10
meters away from the Lata, and a minimum of 17 meters is required between the cliff
and the listener in order to hear an echo.

Then, echo will be heard from Cliff B

∴ Total distance travelled = 2d

= 2 × 160

= 320 m

Solution




7.2. (b) Uranium is available in two forms U-235 and U-238. Which of the two isotopes of
Uranium is more fissionable?

Solution

Comparatively speaking, U-235 is easier to fission than U-238. This is due to the fact that
only fast neutrons can cause the fission of U-238, whereas slow neutrons can even
trigger the fission of U-235.

7.3. In the given diagram, a vibrating tuning fork is kept near the mouth of a burette filled
with water. The length of the air column is adjusted by opening the tap of the burette.

   a. Name the phenomenon illustrated by the above experiment.

   b. Why is a loud sound heard at this particular length?

   c. If the present tuning fork is replaced with a tuning fork of higher frequency,
      should the length of the air column increase or decrease to produce a loud
      sound? Give a reason.
Solution




Q8.

8.1. The voltage - current readings of a certain material are shown in the table given
below:

 Voltage (V) 10 V 20 V 30 V

 Current (I)   2A   3A       4A


Study the table.

   a. State whether the conductor used is ohmic or non-ohmic.

   b. Justify your answer.

   c. State Ohm's law.

Solution




Here, the ratio is not constant, so the conductor is non-ohmic.
8.2. Below is the diagram of a transformer:




   a. Identify the type of transformer.

   b. In this type of transformer which of the wire is thicker, the primary or the
      secondary? Give a reason.

Solution

   a. Step-down transformer.

   b. Due to the step-down transformer's decreased voltage, the secondary coil's wire
      is thicker than the primary coil's. Hence, the secondary coil's current is greater
      than the primary coil's. Thus, the secondary coil needs thick wires.

8.3. Study the diagram:
   a. Calculate the total resistance of the circuit.

   b. Calculate the current drawn from the cell.

   c. State whether the current through 10 Ω resistor is greater than, less than or equal
      to the current through the 12 Ω resistor.

Solution

a. R1 = 10 + 6 = 16 Ω (in series)

R2 = 12 + 4 = 16 Ω (in series)




c. Because the equivalent resistance in both arms is 16 Ω, the current in the 10 Ω resistor
will be equal to the current in the 12 Ω resistor. Thus, equal current will flow through the
10 Ω and 12 Ω resistors as well as in both arms.

Q9.

9.1. 85 g of water at 30°C is cooled to 5°C by adding certain mass of ice. Find the mass of
ice required.

[Specific heat capacity of water = 4 .2 Jg-I°C-1, Specific latent heat of fusion = 336 Jg-1]
Solution

Given, for water

mass (mw) = 85 g

Initial temperature = 30°C

Final temperature = 5°C

For Ice, mass= mi

Initial temperature = 0°C

Final temperature = 5°C

Now

Heat lost by water = mw × c × Δt

= 8.5 × 4.2 × (30 - 5)

= 85 × 4.2 × 25

= 8925 J

Heat gained by ice = mi × L + mi × c × Δt

= mi × 336 + mi × 4.2 × (5 - 0)

= 336 mi + mi × 4.2 × 5

= 336 mi + 21 mi

= 357 mi

By principle of calorimetry

Heat lost by water = Heat gained by ice

8925 = 357 mi




= 25 g
Hence, mass of ice required is 25 g.

9.2. (a) Why does it become pleasantly warm when the lakes start freezing?

Solution

Water's liquid state emits heat into its surroundings as it freezes. This exothermic
process emits heat into the environment. Because the specific latent heat of ice fusion is
high enough, a significant amount of heat must be lost when lake water freezes,
resulting in a nice increase in temperature.

9.2. (b) Water freezes to form ice. What change would you expect in the average kinetic
energy of the molecules?

Solution

The average kinetic energy of the molecules decreases as water freezes to produce ice
because the temperature of the water molecules drops, and they hold to one another to
form a crystal.

9.3. (c) Which has more heat: 1 g ice at 0℃ or 1g water 0℃? Give reason.

Which will contain more heat energy 1 g of ice at 0°C or 1 g water at 0°C?

Solution 1

1 g of water at 0°C has more heat than 1 g of ice at 0°C. This is because ice at 0°C
absorbs 360 J of heat energy to convert into water at 0°C.

Solution 2

At 0°C, 336 J of heat energy is taken in by ice, turning it into water. Water therefore has
higher heat energy at 0°C.

9.3. (a) State one factor that affects the magnitude of induced current in an AC generator.

Solution

Factors on which the magnitude of induced current in an AC circuit depends:

   1. Magnetic field intensity.

   2. Number of turns in the coil.
9.3. (b) Given below is a circuit to study the magnetic effect of electric current. ABCD is a
cardboard kept perpendicular to the conductor XY. A magnetic compass is placed at the
point P of the cardboard. P1 and P2 are the positions of the magnetic compass, before
and after passing a current through XY respectively.




   1. Name the rule that is used to predict the direction of deflection of the magnetic
      compass.

   2. State the direction of current in the conductor (X to Y or Y to X) when the circuit is
      complete.

   3. If resistance R is increased, then what will be the effect on the magnetic lines of
      force around the conductor?

Solution

   1. Right hand thumb rule.

   2. Since the compass is pointing west, the current will flow from X to Y in an
      anticlockwise direction.

   3. The amount of current flowing through the circuit will decrease if the resistance
      increases. The magnetic field then decreases as the magnetic lines of force
      surrounding the conductor grow less dense.
